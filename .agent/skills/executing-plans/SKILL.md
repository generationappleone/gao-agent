# Executing Plans

## Overview

Load a plan, execute tasks systematically, verify continuously, and ship complete features. Sequential by default with optional swarm mode for independent tasks.

**Announce:** "I'm using the executing-plans skill to implement this plan."

## Phase 1: Quick Start

### 1.1 Read and Clarify

- Read the plan document completely
- Review any references or links in the plan
- If anything is unclear or ambiguous, **ask clarifying questions NOW**
- Get user approval to proceed
- **Do not skip this** — better to ask now than build wrong

### 1.2 Setup Environment

**Check Git workflow configuration:**

| Git Workflow | Action |
|-------------|--------|
| `branch` (default) | `git checkout -b feat/<feature-name>` |
| `worktree` | Create isolated worktree: `git worktree add ../<project>-<feat> -b feat/<name>` |
| `none` | Skip git setup, work directly |

**If already on a feature branch:** Ask "Continue on `[branch]`, or create a new branch?"

### 1.3 Create Task Checklist

Break plan into actionable tasks with:
- Dependencies between tasks
- Priority order
- Testing and quality check tasks
- Specific, completable items

### 1.4 Execution Mode Selection

Choose the execution mode:

| Condition | Mode | Skill |
|-----------|------|-------|
| Subagents available AND 3+ independent tasks | **SDD (Subagent-Driven Development)** | `subagent-driven-development` |
| 5+ independent tasks, no shared files | **Swarm (parallel execution)** | This skill (swarm section) |
| Default / tightly coupled tasks | **Sequential** | This skill (default) |

> **SDD is preferred** when subagents are available. Fresh context per task produces higher quality output.

**If SDD selected:**
- Switch to `subagent-driven-development` skill for execution
- This skill handles orchestration and progress tracking

**If Swarm selected:**
- Switch to worktree mode for git
- Create isolated workspaces per agent
- Coordinate via task queue with dependencies

**If Sequential (default):**
- Proceed to Phase 2 below

## Phase 2: Execute

### Sequential Mode (Default)

```
while (tasks remain):
    1. Mark task as in_progress
    2. Read referenced files from plan
    3. Look for similar patterns in codebase
    4. Check architecture rules — verify file goes in correct directory
    5. Implement following existing conventions + architecture rules
    6. Verify dependency direction (no forbidden imports)
    7. Write tests for new functionality
    8. Run tests after changes
    9. Mark task as completed
    10. Check off task in plan document ([ ] → [x])
    11. Evaluate for incremental commit
```

### Incremental Commits

| Commit when... | Don't commit when... |
|----------------|---------------------|
| Logical unit complete | Small part of larger unit |
| Tests pass + meaningful progress | Tests failing |
| About to switch contexts | Purely scaffolding with no behavior |
| About to attempt risky changes | Would need a "WIP" message |

**Heuristic:** "Can I write a commit message describing a complete, valuable change? If yes, commit."

```bash
# 1. Verify tests pass
# 2. Stage related files only (not `git add .`)
git add <files related to this logical unit>
# 3. Commit with conventional message
git commit -m "feat(scope): description"
```

### Follow Existing Patterns

- Load reference files from the plan
- Match naming conventions exactly
- Reuse existing components
- Follow project coding standards
- When in doubt, grep for similar implementations

### Test Continuously

- Run relevant tests after each significant change
- Don't wait until the end to test
- Fix failures immediately
- Add new tests for new functionality

## Phase 3: Quality Check

### Core Quality Checks (Always)

```bash
# Run full test suite
[project test_command]

# Run linting
[project lint_command]
```

### Verification Gate

**Before claiming complete, use verification-before-completion skill:**
1. All tasks marked completed
2. All tests pass (with fresh output)
3. Linting passes
4. Code follows existing patterns
5. Architecture compliance verified
6. No console errors or warnings

## Phase 4: Ship It

### Create Commit (if using Git)

```bash
git add .
git status  # Review what's being committed
git diff --staged  # Check the changes

git commit -m "feat(scope): description of what and why"
```

### Notify User

- Summarize what was completed
- Note any follow-up work needed
- Suggest next steps (review, compound knowledge)

### Branch Completion

After all tasks are complete, use `finishing-a-development-branch` skill for branch completion options (merge, squash, rebase, or archive).

## Key Principles

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Start Fast** | Get clarification once, then execute |
| **Plan is Your Guide** | Follow the plan, don't reinvent |
| **Test As You Go** | After each change, not end |
| **Quality Built In** | Patterns, tests, linting |
| **Ship Complete** | Don't leave features 80% done |

## Red Flags

| Thought | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| "Skip clarifying questions" | Ask now, not after building wrong thing |
| "Ignore plan references" | The plan has references for a reason |
| "Test at the end" | Test continuously or suffer later |
| "80% done is fine" | Finish the feature. Ship complete. |
| "Tests pass, we're done" | Use verification-before-completion skill |

## Integration

**Prerequisite skills:**
- **writing-plans** — Creates the plan this skill executes
- **using-gao-agent** — Master controller (loaded via skill-routing rule)

**Skills used during execution:**
- **subagent-driven-development** — SDD execution mode (preferred)
- **test-driven-development** — Each task follows TDD
- **verification-before-completion** — Before claiming done
- **systematic-debugging** — When things break during execution
- **finishing-a-development-branch** — Branch completion options

**This skill feeds into:**
- **code-review** — Review completed implementation
- **knowledge-compounding** — Document learnings

**This skill is governed by:**
- `rules/skill-routing.md` — Master controller hook
