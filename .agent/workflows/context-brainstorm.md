# Context Brainstorm Workflow

This workflow explores ideas and turns them into designs. Use it when you have a rough idea that needs refinement.

## Steps

1. **Read the brainstorming skill** — Load `skills/brainstorming/SKILL.md` and follow its process.

2. **Phase 0: Assess** — Determine if brainstorming is needed or requirements are already clear.

3. **Phase 1: Understand** — Research the codebase and `.agent/context/` docs for context, then ask questions ONE AT A TIME.

4. **Phase 2: Explore** — Present 2-3 approaches with trade-offs. Lead with recommendation.

5. **Phase 3: Design** — Present the design in 200-300 word sections, validating each.
   - If the idea involves **frontend/UI work**, the brainstorming skill auto-invokes `ui-ux-pro-max` for design intelligence.

6. **Phase 3.5: Compatibility Check** — If the brainstorm introduces new technologies/dependencies:
   - Flag potential compatibility issues with existing stack
   - Reference `skills/compatibility-check/SKILL.md` for quick validation
   - Note any required skill gaps (see `/context-plan` Phase 1.5)

7. **Phase 4: Capture** — Save brainstorm document to `docs/brainstorms/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-brainstorm.md`.

8. **Handoff** — Ask: "Ready to create an implementation plan? I can run the plan workflow next."

## When to Use
- New feature ideas
- Unclear requirements
- Architecture decisions
- Before any creative work

## When to Skip
- Requirements are already detailed and specific
- Small bug fixes with clear reproduction steps
- Direct tasks ("add field X to model Y")
